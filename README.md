# SeedEncrypt
## The bep39 seed phrase encryption tool
- A given seed phrase is encrypted by password to a pair of fake seed phrases
- Providing valid password, the pair of fake seed phrases is decrypted and the original seed phrase is restored
- Wrong password provides just another fake seed phrase
- It's not possible to distinguish a fake seed phrase from a regular one
- It's not possible to detect if the fake seed phrases are a result of encryption
